## About The Project


I made this plugin since I have had several CSGO servers and I had the problem that every time a server update came out, I had to go and delete the maps that were automatically downloaded, for which I made this plugin

### Installation

1. Download the latest version.
2. Put deletemap.smx in the directory /addons/sourcemod/plugins/
3. Restart the server/change the current map.
